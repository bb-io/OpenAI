# Blackbird.io OpenAI

Blackbird is the new automation backbone for the language technology industry. Blackbird provides enterprise-scale automation and orchestration with a simple no-code/low-code platform. Blackbird enables ambitious organizations to identify, vet and automate as many processes as possible. Not just localization workflows, but any business and IT process. This repository represents an application that is deployable on Blackbird and usable inside the workflow editor.

## Introduction

<!-- begin docs -->

This OpenAI app in Blackbird grants you access to all API endpoints and models that OpenAI has to offer from completion, chat, edit to DALL-E image generation and Whisper.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/) and organization and have access to the API keys.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for OpenAI. If you cannot find OpenAI then click _Add App_ in the top right corner, select OpenAI and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My OpenAI connection'.
4. Fill in your Organization ID that you can find in your [OpenAI organization settings](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings). The organization ID has the shape `org-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.
5. Fill in your API key. You can create a new API key under [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). The API key has the shape `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.
6. Click _Connect_.

## Actions

### General

- **Get helpcenter locales** returns both the default locale of the helpcenter, as well as the list of locales that have been configured in Zendesk. You can find these settings in the Zendesk help center > Settings > Language settings.
- **Delete translation** can be used with any translation retrieved from articles, categories or sections.

### Articles

- **Get all articles** fetches all articles that have updated since a configurable amount of hours. You can use this endpoint to schedule birds that fetch all the updated content in order to translate this content. Optionally you can also specify the category, which will limit the search to that specific category. You can also specify the _Missing translation in_ variable, in which case this action will only return articles that are actually missing translations in that language.
- **Create/update/archive article**.
- **Get article missing translations** returns a list of locales that have been configured in Zendesk but are not present for this article. It can be used to create the missing translations.
- **Update article translation** creates a translation if there is none, or updates the translation if it already exists.

Furthermore, we have created a useful set of actions in order to treat Zendesk articles as HTML files. This allows you to create workflows translating Zendesk articles without individually sending the title and content strings for translation.

- **Get article as HTML file** returns an HTML file with the header title as the article title and the body populated with the article content.
- **Update article translation from HTML file** expects an HTML file with a similar structure as the previous action. For the rest it behaves the same as _Update article translation_.

### Categories

- **Get all categories** returns all categories on this Zendesk instance. You can also specify the _Missing translation in_ variable, in which case this action will only return categories that are actually missing translations in that language.
- **Get category articles** returns all articles in this category.
- **Create/update/delete category**.
- **Get category missing translations** returns a list of locales that have been configured in Zendesk but are not present for this category. It can be used to create the missing translations.
- **Update category translation** creates a translation if there is none, or updates the translation if it already exists.

### Sections

- **Get all sections** returns all sections on this Zendesk instance. Optionally you can also specify the category, which will limit the search to that specific category. You can also specify the _Missing translation in_ variable, in which case this action will only return sections that are actually missing translations in that language.
- **Create/update/delete section**.
- **Get section missing translations** returns a list of locales that have been configured in Zendesk but are not present for this section. It can be used to create the missing translations.
- **Update section translation** creates a translation if there is none, or updates the translation if it already exists.

### Tickets

- **Create/update/delete ticket**.

## Events

- **On article published** is the most useful event. This event is triggered when any article is published and could be the perfect trigger for sending the article for translation based on the missing translations (see example).
- **Other** events for article comments, subscriptions, votes and user events.

## Example

![example](image/README/1692615904702.png)
This example shows one of many use cases. Here, whenever an article is published we fetch the missing translations and retrieve the article as an HTML file. Then we create a new Lokalise project with the missing locales as the target languages and upload the article. Then we send a Slack message to notify the project manager.

## Missing features

Most content related actions exist. However, in the future we can add actions for:

- Article attachments
- Topics and Posts
- Comments
- Subscriptions
- Votes
- In depth tickets
